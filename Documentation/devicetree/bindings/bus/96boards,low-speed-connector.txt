96Boards Low Speed Connectors

The 96Boards connectors represent a non-dicoverable Low Speed (LS)
and High Speed (HS) external bus on the 96Board development
boards. Each 96Board presents both of these connectors.

The Low Speed (LS) connector is a 40 pin 2x20 female pin header:
- Power
- Two buttons: power and reset
- 2 x UART one optional with just RX/TX, one required with modem
  CTS/RTS
- 2 x I2C
- 1 x SPI
- 1 x I2S (audio)
- 12 x GPIO lines named GPIO-A thru GPIO-L

Further details on the electronics and signals are available in
"96Boards Consumer Edition, Low Cost Hardware Platform Specification"
As of writing version 1.0, January 2015.

Required properties:

- compatible: shall be "96boards,low-speed-connector"
- i2c0: phandle to the I2C0 bus
- i2c1: phandle to the I2C1 bus
- spi: phandle to the SPI bus
- gpios: a list of phandles to the GPIOs connected to the
  connector. The handles need to be uniformly specified with the
  0 flag as the connector is not the end consumer.

Example:

lscon: connector {
	compatible = "96boards,low-speed-connector";
	i2c0 = <&i2csw_0>;
	i2c1 = <&i2csw_1>;
	spi = <&spi0>;
	gpios = <&gpio 36 0>, /* GPIO-A */
	        <&gpio 37 0>, /* GPIO-B */
		<&gpio 39 0>, /* GPIO-C */
		<&gpio 40 0>, /* GPIO-D */
		<&gpio 44 0>, /* GPIO-E */
		<&gpio 45 0>, /* GPIO-F */
		<&gpio 78 0>, /* GPIO-G */
		<&gpio 79 0>, /* GPIO-H */
		<&gpio 80 0>, /* GPIO-I */
		<&gpio 81 0>, /* GPIO-J */
		<&gpio 82 0>, /* GPIO-K */
		<&gpio 83 0>; /* GPIO-L */
};
